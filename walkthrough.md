### Minigame section
Run from tsunami/earthquake/blizzard.
There are different kinds of obstacles in every scenario. Tsunami you have to avoid non-tsunami-proof buildings as you run to a sanctuary.
Earthquake, things will be falling from the sky as you run to a desk/park/sanctuary.
Blizzard you'll be running to warmth.
More food means more stamina, if you bought a boat or lifesaver you can swim for a short/long amount of time. (instead of not at all).
A desk would spare you one instance of damage from a falling object.
Blocking enemy players in the autoscroller is not useful, but can be done to make your friends mad.
