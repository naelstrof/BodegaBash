Sprint 2 Doc

**First Playable:**

-
  -
    - Bullet Points for what we need to get done in each category
- **Visual Target**
  - A Visual Target is what the game is going to look like in finished form. That does not mean I am looking for finished graphics in the First Playable, it means that you are working towards a representation of the finished graphics. This can be represented in the form of concept art.
- **Have core functionality**
  - These are the moves that the character(s) perform in the game. If you have power ups then they need to work. If you have a vehicle in the game it needs to perform similarly as it would in the finished game.
    - Movement of car is smooth and adds to playability
    - Drifting, bounce turning, jumping
    - Grabbing items
    - Power ups
    - Split screen
    - Menu/Character Selection
- **Have a simple functioning User Interface (front end and HUD)**
  - The front end with splash screen with a logo (placeholder okay) and a &#39;Start Game&#39; button.
    - Home screen
  - The Heads Up Display should have something working in it that helps support the game play.
    - Mini player map on screen during gameplay
  - After the game is done a splash screen should appear with a &#39;Quit&#39; button and a &#39;Play Again&#39; button.
    - End screen
- **1 Environment**
