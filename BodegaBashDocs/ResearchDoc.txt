Research everything you can about your chosen game subject.  Be prepared to present your findings in class.  Use the IDEO videos for inspiration (links are in the syllabus).
Research should include the following:
•	Everyday users – people get info from (emergency essentials), people who have experienced natural disasters (Dalton) 
•	Thorough online study
•	Social Scientists/Anthropology – anyone familiar with product, culture community, people who have studied natural disasters  (Marina)
•	Educating yourself on everything you can about your subject
•	Problems with current/similar products or information
•	Solutions

How Prepared are People really?

Experience from People in Natural Disasters?
	-Stay Calm
	-Have a plan
	-Know where to meet up afterwards
	-Be willing to help, but make sure you are capable of helping first
	-Follow professionals
	-Have an emergency travel kit ready
	-Be prepared for all types of scenerios when a natural disaster occurs (dark, storm, etc)
	-Have a way to communicate
	-Watch news, or local radio to stay updated.
	-Know where they will hand out emergency supplies (usually have some kind of rendevous point)

Tips from professionals?

Most deadly disasters, why?
	There are mainly two types of disasters, natural and unnatural(technology based). In 2013 it was reported that there were 337 	disasters related to natural hazards and 192 related to technological hazards (http://www.ifrc.org/world-disasters-report-		2014/data).
	Given the top 10 deadliest disasters: Earthquakes were 5/10, Cyclones were 3/10, and floods were 2/10 	(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_natural_disasters_by_death_toll).

	Tsunami-
If a major earthquake or landslide happens close to shore, a tsunami's first wave could be there in a matter of minutes, possibly before a warning is even issued. Hazards include flooding, contamination of drinking water, and fires from gas lines or ruptured tanks.\
		Prepare: Have a plan and emergency kit. Practice your plan in many different scenerios(dark, storm, etc.). Know the city 		and school/work emergency plan. If cannot reach an evacuation location, know of strong concrete buildings and do a 		vertical evacuation. Keep updated with Tsunami warning and advisory, as they will tell you about your specific area, and 
		will be updated.
		During: evacuate immediately to high ground or inland. If you can see the wave you are too close to escape it. If there is 
		a noticible recession in shoreline this is natures warning, get away immediately. Save yourself not posessions. 
		After: Do not assume that there aren't more waves, it is a series and the next could be larger. Go home after officials 
		say it is safe. Stay away from debris. Helped those who are trapped with professionals, since doing it alone usually 
		results in more injuries. Stay away from buildings with water around it. Wear protective clothing and be cautious.

	Earthquake- 
One of mother natures deadliest disasters. Roughtly 400,000 people have died from earthquakes in the past decade alone (https://www.statista.com/statistics/263108/global-death-toll-due-to-earthquakes-since-2000/). One reason Earthquakes are deadly is because currently, they cannot be predicted when they will happen.
		Prepare: Identify locations where you can hide and shield your head and neck. Stay away from objects that can fall or 				cause damage. Store essential equipment. Have an emergency plan i.e. how to communicate with your family? Where you will 			meet up? Make sure your residence is up to code.
		During: Stay where you are until shaking stops. Drop down so you don't fall over. Stay away from windows or objects that 			can fall. If you are outside try and stay away from buildings, trees, etc. If in a city try and find cover in a building.
		After: Once shaking stops, if there is a clearing and safe path go there. Be prepared for more shaking due to aftershocks.
		Try and get in contact with people, and locate to a designated safe area.
		(https://www.ready.gov/earthquakes)
		Extra Tips: Check electric, gas lines after earthquake, do not use open flames in earthquake. Once the shaking has 				stopped, start filling up all containers with water (bathtub, sink, bottles) as the water lines will be shut off if they 			haven't already. Do not use elevators. Stay away from the ocean, earthquakes can result in tsunamis.

	Etc. (List any other disaster along with research about it)-

What can we do to prepare?
	-Pre: Have a plan, be taught ahead of time. Have storage and supplies readily available in both household and a bag to take with 	      you.
	-During: Follow your local news, radio, etc. To know updated status of disaster and additional warnings. Follow protocol due 
	      specific disaster.
	-Post: Get in contact, follow instruction of professionals. Follow due protocol per disaster.

Important Items  vs Specific Disaster?
	Earthquake: flashlight, fire extinguisher, water, food, supplies(toilet paper, bags, clothes)
	Tsunami: Food, water, flotation device

What age should we start learning about?
	Younger children may cry, whine or wet the bed in emergency situations. Older children may experience an intense fear of injury or 	separation anxiety. Other common reactions include a fear of the dark, physical pain and eating or sleeping problems.
	Teach about natural hazards not only in their area, but others as well. Make a family emergency plan, prepare emergency kit. Make 		sure they know what io do in the case they aren't home. Role play.
